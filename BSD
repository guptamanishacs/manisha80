1)Developmental Model:The BSD license is often associated with a more permissive and decentralized developmental model. It allows developers to freely modify and distribute the software without many restrictions.BSD codebases have historically been developed collaboratively by a community of contributors, both individual developers and organizations.

2)Licensing:The BSD license is known for its simplicity and permissiveness. It grants users the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software, as long as they retain the original copyright notice.Unlike some other open-source licenses, the BSD license imposes minimal requirements on derivative works, making it suitable for a wide range of projects.

3)Mode of Funding:The development of BSD-licensed software has been funded through a variety of means. It has received support from academic institutions, government agencies, and private organizations.Some projects rely on volunteer contributions, while others have received financial backing for specific features or enhancements.

4)Commercial/Non-Commercial Use:The BSD license permits both commercial and non-commercial use of the software. This means that individuals, businesses, and organizations can use BSD-licensed software for their purposes, including for-profit activities.

This licensing model has made BSD-licensed code attractive for commercial software development because it imposes fewer restrictions on how the code can be incorporated into proprietary products.
